/**
 * Single shared Web Locks helper used by ALL IndexedDB-touching modules
 * (offlineStore.ts, offlineStorage.ts) so they serialize against each
 * other, not just against themselves.
 *
 * Fix for #829:
 *  - Previously each file had its OWN copy of this function with its own
 *    lock name, so writes in offlineStore.ts never waited on writes in
 *    offlineStorage.ts even though both touch overlapping favorite state.
 *  - Previously, if the locked callback threw, the surrounding try/catch
 *    treated that as "the Locks API itself failed" and re-ran the callback
 *    a SECOND time with no lock at all — silently defeating serialization
 *    on exactly the call that most needed it (the one that errored).
 *    That unlocked retry is what let rapid concurrent writes interleave
 *    and silently drop earlier queued outbox entries.
